# Recommender-System
In the world of online shopping, making sure customers find what they want quickly is crucial. But what happens when a new customer comes along, or when a store introduces a new product? This challenge, known as the cold start problem, can make it difficult to deliver personalized recommendations right away. Our project tackles this issue head-on by using Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) enhanced with contextual data.Here, we used the online retails sales dataset from UCL.
